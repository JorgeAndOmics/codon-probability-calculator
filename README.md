# Aminoacid_Probability_Calculator
Universal calculator for codon probability in the Biopython repository (https://github.com/biopython/biopython).
Calculates the probability of apparition of a certain aminoacid from the codon count present in the Biopython repository, assuming all codons are equiprobable. Calculations are for both regular and extended IUPAC dictionaries(modified aminoacids), for the species selected.
