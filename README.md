# Codon Probability Calculator

This script allows the user to select a codon table from a list of 27 options and generate the probability of each amino acid based on that table. The user can select between a regular amino acid dictionary and an extended amino acid dictionary.

## Requirements

This script requires the following Python packages to be installed:

-   Biopython


## Usage

To use this script, simply run it in your Python environment. You will be prompted to select a codon table from the list of options. Enter the number corresponding to the desired table and press Enter.

You will then be prompted to select a dictionary type: regular or extended. The regular dictionary contains the 20 standard amino acids, while the extended dictionary includes additional amino acids like selenocysteine and pyrrolysine.

The script will then output the probability of each amino acid based on the selected codon table and dictionary type.
